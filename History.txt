History of Arduino Mega2560 SD2IEC LCD project

23.12.2019
First try on the SD2IEC LCD 0.8d, unfinished, only for test if the LCD_NEW library work with NO RW pin.

29.12.2019
First run without any errors on the modified SD2IEC LCD 1.0.0. code on the Arduino Mega2560 with LCD shield.

14.1.2020
Added LED between AN0 and AN1 for .d64 button. File SD2IEC2.hex


24.1.2020
Added Digispark module for translate between keypad analog keys and digital input for keys. Next key moved on AN2. Program for Digispark written in the GCBasic.

Source, hex and Micronucleus files for programing are stored in the /ATtiny85 directory.

4.2.2020
Added Digispark FW  writen in the Arduino IDE /Attiny85/Arduino_IDE/tiny85.ino.

13.2.2020

Added an error message in the lcd.h file.

8.3.2021

Source Files sync with the last version of sd2iec lcd by SvOlli.


21.5.2021 


- The lcd.c and lcd.h file now is compatible with other HW versions.
- 4 partitions setting in config file.
- 4 new fastloaders.
- Source sync with the last version of sd2iec lcd by SyOlli and Ingo Korb.


29.6.2021 

- Fix in XS-1541 configuration;
- makebin script for compile all version at once;

3.4.2022
- Bugfix in timer.c to prevent compiler error in case when Arduino variant is set with no LCD
- OPTION_CLK renamed in OPION_PORT (lcd.c lcd.h)
- The choice of which version of lcd.c is compiled is now dependent on whether the
  LCD_RW_ PIN is defined or not, no longer via HW variant
- /doc folder divided in more subfolders

From https://github.com/thierer/sd2iec/tree/more_fastloaders
