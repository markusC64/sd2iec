Wheels fast loader protocol
===========================

Documented by Ingo Korb

Wheels 4.4 note
---------------
Although the analyzed pre-4.4 versions of wheels had a nice,
consistent loader design with just two different byte
transmission/reception variations and a fully compatible protocol
between all drive types, Wheels 4.4 ditched that for some reason. The
protocol is still similiar to the previous versions, but there are
some important differences which depend on the drive type. The pre-4.4
versions are used as the baseline in this document, changes in 4.4 are
noted where appropiate.

Low-Level byte transmission
---------------------------
Both data and clock should be set to high already from previous
operations. Using the high->low transition of clock as a timing
reference, send bits as shown in the following table. For older
versions of Wheels the timing and bit order only differs between 1MHz
(154) and 2MHz (everything else) drives. Wheels 4.4 runs the 1571 in
1MHz mode using the 1541 timing from previous Wheels versions and
uses a slowed-down timing for the 1581 and CMD drives.

1541 (all versions) and 1571 (Wheels 4.4):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
    9us   !b3  !b1
   23us   !b2  !b0
   37us   !b7  !b5
   51us   !b6  !b4
   73us    -    -   (hold time so the C64 has time to read b6/b4)

2MHz (Wheels pre-4.4 - identical to GEOS 1581 with Configure 2.1):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
    7us    b0   b1
   14us    b2   b3
   24us    b4   b5
   33us    b6   b7
   45us    -    -   (hold time so the C64 has time to read b6/b7)

1581/CMD (Wheels 4.4):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
    7us    b0   b1
   15us    b2   b3
   26us    b4   b5
   37us    b6   b7
   52us    -    -   (hold time so the C64 has time to read b6/b7)


Low-Level byte reception
------------------------
Both data and clock should be set to high already from previous
operations. Using the high->low transition of clock as a timing
reference, receive bits as shown in the following table. The timing
and bit order differs for 1MHz (1541) and 2MHz (everything else)
drives:

1MHz (Wheels pre-4.4):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
   16us   !b7  !b5
   26us   !b6  !b4
   41us   !b3  !b1
   54us   !b2  !b0

2MHz (Wheels pre-4.4 - identical to GEOS 2MHz timing):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
   15us   !b4  !b5
   29us   !b6  !b7
   39.5us !b3  !b1
   50.5us !b2  !b0

1541/1571 (Wheels 4.4):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
   17us   !b7  !b5
   28us   !b6  !b4
   45us   !b3  !b1
   61us   !b2  !b0
   81us   -    -    (recommended delay before returning)

1581/CMD (Wheels 4.4):
   Time  Clock Data
   ----------------
    0us  1->0  (1)  (timing reference)
   15us   !b0  !b1
   26us   !b2  !b3
   37us   !b4  !b5
   48us   !b6  !b7
   60us   -    -    (recommended delay before returning)


Receiving a block
-----------------
Data is transferred from the C64 to the drive in blocks of variable
size from 1-256 bytes. A block transfer of k bytes happens as follows:

- wait until clock is high
- set data high
(- delay 15us?)
- receive k bytes, starting at the end of the buffer
- Wheels 4.4 only: Wait until clock is low
- set data low

Unlike GEOS, the block length is always determined on the drive
side. The only sizes used are 4 bytes for commands and 256 bytes when
receiving a sector to write.

Transmitting a block
--------------------
When transferring data to the C64 the block size is variable from 1 to
256 bytes and is not explicitly sent to the computer. A block transfer
of k bytes happens as follows:

- wait until clock is high
- set data and clock high
- transmit all k data bytes, starting with the last byte
- delay 20us
- Wheels pre-4.4 and 4.4 on 1541/1571:
  - set data low, clock high
  - wait until clock is low
- Wheels 4.4 on 1581/CMD
  - set data and clock high
  - wait until clock is low
  - set data low


Parallel block transfer (HD only)
---------------------------------
Note: This section is based on a disassembly of the drive code only
and has not been verified in reality.

Wheels can utilize the parallel port of the CMD HD for increased
transfer speed. Before every block transfer the drive checks if a flag
byte at $031e (inside the drive code) has bit 7 set - if it is set,
parallel mode is used instead of the serial transfer described
above. The flag is never set within the drive code, it is assumed that
it'll be set when the code is uploaded (if at all). The flag is reset
in the drive code in a single place - if the high byte of the RPC
address is anything except $03, the code calls STATUS, sets clock/data
high, clears the parallel flag and runs QUIT to exit.

NOTE: Wheels 4.4 does not use the serial port at all after starting
the drive code with the parallel mode flag set. Instead of waiting for
a certain state on the clock line it waits for the inverted state on
bit 6 of port B (PB6) of the 8255 and instead of setting the data line low
or high it sets bit 7 of port C (PC7) of the 8255 to high/low. It is
currently assumed that those two pins are connected to the handshake
lines of the parallel connector of the HD, but it is not known if this
connection is inverted or not.

Parallel block reception pre-4.4
--------------------------------
The parallel block reception is called instead of the standard block
reception subroutine and expects a byte count (1-256) as parameter.

- wait until clock is high
- set data and clock high
- reception loop:
  - wait until clock is low
  - read parallel port
  - set data low
  - store received byte
  - decrement count
  - exit loop if count is now 0

  - wait until clock is high
  - read parallel port
  - set data high
  - store received byte
  - decrement count
  - exit loop if count is now 0
- wait until clock is low (always, exit point in loop doesn't matter)
- set data low (same)

Parallel block reception 4.4
----------------------------
Again the parallel block reception is called instead of the standard
block reception subroutine.

- reception loop (one iteration per byte):
  - wait until PB6 is 0
  - read parallel port
  - set PC7 to 1
  - wait until PB6 is 1
  - set PC7 to 0
  - store received byte

Parallel block transmission pre-4.4
-----------------------------------
The parallel block transmission is called instead of the standard
block transmission subroutine and expects a byte count (1-256) as
parameter.

- set parallel port to output
- wait until clock is high
- set clock and data high
- transmission loop:
  - wait until clock is low
  - read next data byte
  - send byte to parallel port
  - set data low
  - wait until clock is high
  - decrement count
  - exit loop if count is now 0

  - read next data byte
  - send byte to parallel port
  - set data high
  - decrement count
  - exit loop if count is now 0
- set clock/data high
- wait until clock is low
- set data low
- set parallel port to input

Parallel block transmission 4.4
-------------------------------
Again the parallel block transmission is called instead of the
standard block transmission subroutine.

- set parallel port to output
- reception loop (one iteration per byte):
  - read next data byte
  - wait until PB6 is 0
  - send byte to parallel port
  - set PC7 to 1
  - wait until PB6 is 1
  - set PC7 to 0
- set parallel port to input

Stage 1 loader
--------------
Note: This stage is only used for 1541/1571 drives, all others load
the system file with standard KERNAL calls.

The stage 1 loader is a fixed-filename loader that searches for a
predetermined file and transmits it to the computer. The file name is
"SYSTEM1" for the C64 version and "128SYSTEM1" for the C128. In the
1541 loader it is located at $5d9 in drive memory, the number of
characters compared is at $597. The name in drive memory is terminated
with a $a0 character that is included in the comparision.

The stage 1 loader does the following:
- wait until clock is low
- set data low
- attempt to open the target file (SYSTEM1 or 128SYSTEM1)
  - return to the dos main loop if the file wasn't found
- transfer each sector of the file:
  - wait until clock is high
  - set clock/data high
  - transmit the sector contents starting at the end
  - set data low
  - wait until clock is low
  - advance to the next sector in the chain
  - exit after the last sector of the file was transferred
- wait until clock is low
- set clock/data high
- return to the dos main loop


Stage 2 functions
=================
Note: Addresses are for Wheels versions before 4.4. In 4.4 the jump
table is moved to 0403 for the 1541/1571, to 0503 for the CMD FD/HD,
but stays at 0303 for the 1581.

Exiting the fastloader (QUIT - 0303)
------------------------------------
This function exits the fast loader and returns to the standard dos
main loop. Wheels may restart the loader with M-E without re-uploading
the drive code.

- wait until clock is high
- set clock/data high
- return to the dos main loop

Writing a sector (WRITE - 0306)
-------------------------------
This function receives a sector (256 bytes) and writes them to the
track/sector already received in the function call. After writing it
jumps to the STATUS function.

Reading a sector (READ - 0309)
------------------------------
This function reads the track/sector that was received together with
the function address and transmits it to the computer. Regardless of
the success of the read operation, the full 256 bytes of data are
always transmitted as a block transfer. After transmitting the sector
data the loader jumps to the STATUS function.

Reading a sector link pointer (READLINK - 030c)
-----------------------------------------------
This function works exactly as READ, but transmits only the first two
bytes of the sector instead of its full contents.

Transmitting the job result (STATUS - 030f)
-------------------------------------------
This function uses the block transfer operation to transmit a single
byte to the C64. This byte is the job result code from the buffer that
is used for disk operations.

Calculating the number of free blocks (NATIVE_FREE - 0312)
----------------------------------------------------------
This function calculates the number of free blocks in a CMD native
partition. The first parameter byte is the sector number of the last
BAM sector that should be read, the second parameter is the last
byte in that sector that should be added into the result ($00 means
every byte). Currently there has been no situation observed in which
those two parameters had values that would limit the calculation to
less than the entire partition.

The function transmits two bytes to the C64 which are the number of
free sectors in the current partition (must be CMD native, but isn't
used for anything else anyway) in little-endian byte order. After
transmitting this function calls the STATUS function.

Reading the current partition and dir (GET_CURRENT_PART_DIR - 0315)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This function transmits three bytes to the C64. The first two are the
track and sector of the directory head sector of the current directory
in the current partition, the third is the number of the current
partition (1-based as usual).

Setting the current partition and dir (SET_CURRENT_PART_DIR - 0318)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This function changes the current directory and/or partition. It
received three bytes from the C64. The third byte is the new current
partition (0 indicates no change), the first two bytes are used as the
current directory head track and sector in that partition.

Checking for disk change (CHECK_CHANGE - 031b)
----------------------------------------------
This function transmits a single byte to the computer using the block
transfer operation. The byte is either $00 if the disk was not changed
or $03 if it was. On a 1541 the flag value is obtained from address
$1c which will be set on a disk change, but is not reset at all while
the loader is running. If this function returns a "disk changed"
state, Wheels will exit the loader and send the Initialize dos
command. A simple implementation that always returns $03 works fine
for 1541/71/81 modes, but will fail if a CMD FD is emulated.

In Wheels 4.4 an implementation that always returns $03 will fail for
every drive type (except HD). For a 1571 Wheels 4.4 expects a return
value of 0 for single-sided disks or $80 for double-sided disks (value
taken from byte 4 of sector 18/0).


Stage 2 loader
--------------
The stage 2 loader uses a remote function call system similiar to the
GEOS 2.0 stage 2/3 loaders. It starts with a simple handshake:

- wait until clock is low
- set data low

After that it starts its main loop:

- wait until clock is high
- turn on drive LED
- receive 4 bytes (in transmission order: sector, track, highbyte, lowbyte)
- jump to the address received
- wait until clock is low
- turn off drive LED
- restart loader main loop

Unlike the GEOS loaders Wheels calls every function using a jump table
located at $0303-$031d, so the addresses transmitted are the same for
every drive type.

0303: QUIT
0306: WRITE
0309: READ
030c: READLINK
030f: STATUS
0312: NATIVE_FREE
0315: GET_CURRENT_PART_DIR
0318: SET_CURRENT_PART_DIR
031b: CHECK_CHANGE

NOTE: Wheels 4.4 moves the jump table to 0403 on the 1541 and 1571 or
0503 on the CMD FD/HD, but the functions and their order is the same.

For CMD drives there are two variations of the loader - one is used
for native partitions and implements NATIVE_FREE and
GET_CURRENT_PART_DIR, the other is used for 1581 partitions and omits
those two functions.

The CMD FD is the only drive that implements all of these
functions. For the HD, the CHECK_CHANGE function is always dummied out
(nop/nop/rts), for standard Commodore drives the NATIVE_FREE,
GET_CURRENT_PART_DIR and SET_CURRENT_PART_DIR functions are dummied
out (nop/nop/rts).
