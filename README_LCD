Some project history
====================

This software is based on the sd2iec-0.10.3 software by Ingo Korb. 
First the LCD functionality made by Draco for an older version was added by Seanser.
Then andi6510 added support for DOGM LCD modules based on a ST7036 controller
and did some tidy up work by removing all remaining non-LCD related differences 
between Seansers version and the official sd2iec-0.10.3.

This software was tested on an ATMEGA1284p microcontroller with a ST7036 based 
DOGM162 module and another HD44780 based module (exact type unkonwn).


5.10.2021 Poldi added full support for the Arduino Mega 2560 and
LCD keypad shield (support for HD44780 displays where R/W pin
is tied to GND. Also added new command XL to get information
about LCD type is build in the yours SD2IEC LCD.

14.10.2021 Poldi added new coommand T-RL.
For more information see notes below.

25.11.2021 Poldi added new coommand XB that shows the boot message.

4.1.2022 Poldi added table of available values with description for the XTC command.

14.1.2023 Poldi rename conflictong XL command in the XTL command,

README_LCD - this file



Modified files of sd2iec 1.0.1
===============================

buffer.c - display "READY" when the last buffer has been closed - seems more a hack and should be replaced with a proper solution
d64ops.c - display "LOAD" and "SAVE" when files are accessed in a D64 image
doscmd.c - display various messages on each command - add LCD specific X-commands: XT XA XG XX XC
eeprom.c - add LCD-contrast setting to eeprom storage
errormsg.c - display current error message
fatops.c - display current directory
fileops.c - display "LOAD" and "SAVE" files (CapFuture)
main.c - initialise LCD functions, display welcome screen, debug output of detected LCD type
Makefile - added files display_lcd.c and lcd.c to build process, added prerelease tag LCD



Additional Commands available via IEC
=====================================

XT* Text Commands
-----------------

The display can be accessed from the c64!
Use commands "XT1" and "XT2" to send text to display line 1 or 2.
The addressed line will be cleared before text is printed.

Example 1 - send "Lightyears ahead!" to line1:

OPEN15,8,15,"XT1Lightyears ahead!"

The "XTC" command allows to send a control code followed by data, which makes it possible
to program the display from the C64 side, e.g. define own characters.

Example2 - clear the screen:

OPEN15,8,15,"XTC"+CHR$(1) will clear the screen.

Example 3 - define a special character with a "heart" (line 2) and print it 3 times (line 3):
1 OPEN15,8,15
2 PRINT#15,"XTC"+CHR$(64)+CHR$(27)+CHR$(31)+CHR$(31)+CHR$(14)+CHR$(4)+CHR$(0)+CHR $(0)
3 print#15,"XT1"+CHR$(8)+CHR$(8)+CHR$(8)
4 CLOSE15

Other valuses for XTC command
-----------------------------

The XTC command set LCD specific instructions as shown in the table below:

Value   I| Instruction
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1        | Clear Screen
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2        | Home (move cursor to top/left character position)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
8       |  Blank the display (without clearing)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
12      |  Restore the display (with cursor hidden)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
12      |  Make cursor invisible
-----------------------------------------------------------------
14      |  Turn on visible underline cursor
-----------------------------------------------------------------
15      |  Turn on visible blinking-block cursor
-----------------------------------------------------------------
16      |  Move cursor one character left
-----------------------------------------------------------------
20      |  Move cursor one character right
-----------------------------------------------------------------
24      | Scroll display one character left (all lines)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
28      | Scroll display one character right (all lines)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
64+addr | Set pointer in character-generator RAM (CG RAM address) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
128+sddr| Set cursor position (DDRAM address)



Display About Message
----------------------

The XA command shows a small about message:

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XA"

Display Greetings & Credits
---------------------------

The XG command shows the greetings and credits:

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XG"

Display Boot Message
--------------------

The XB command shows the boot message:

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XB"



Display current directory
-------------------------

The XTR command shows the current directory or mounted image:

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XTR"



Undocumented experimental feature
----------------------------------

The XX command is not documented. It might cause skynet to
link all computers together to play a game of global
thermonuclear war.

Maybe your C64 is not connected to skynet, so you'll give it a try.
Good luck!

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XX"


Setup LCD contrast (only for ST7036 based displays)
---------------------------------------------------

The XC command changes the display contrast on a ST7036 based display
Valid contrast values  go from 0 to 63. 

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XC 40"

Note:
Once contrast is adjusted properly the setting can be saved with the XW command!

Display LCD type
----------------------

The XTL command shows the LCD type (HD44780 or ST7036) on the given SD2IEC LCD:

Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"XTL"

Also sent this information via error channel to C64: 
95 NO_LCD
96 HD44780
97 ST7036

Display current date&time on the LCD
(only if RTC module is present)
------------------------------------

If your hardware features RTC and LCD support, the command
T-RL display current date and time in ISO 8601 format on the
LCD screen for aprox 8 seconds.


Example:

OPEN15,8,15,"T-RL"

Note:

If the RTC isn't present, command return:
30,SYNTAX ERROR,00,00

If the RTC is present but not set correctly T-RL will return:
31,SYNTAX ERROR,00,00.

LCD Hardware
============

Every HD 44780 or ST7036 compatible displays (2x16 or 2x20 chars) should work
The display is accessed in 4-bit mode.

Different pinouts have to be used depending on the hardware variant
of the SD2IEC / MMC2IEC device:

sd2iec V1.4 by Shadowolf (sw1 variant)
MMC2IEC by Lars Pontoppidan (larsp variant)
-------------------------------------------
(original design, also used by PCBs from Peter Sieg)

Display Atmega
RS PB0
RW PB1
E PB2
DB4 PC4
DB5 PC5
DB6 PC6
DB7 PC7


sd2iec V1.6 by Shadowolf (sw2 variant)
--------------------------------------
ATTENTION: I have not yet tested this pinout so it might be possible that it is not working.
At least it will be hard to solder the display to PB0,PB1 and PB3 if using a TQFP44 mcu.

Display Atmega
RS PB0
RW PB1
E PB3

DB4 PC4
DB5 PC5
DB6 PC6
DB7 PC7

For other variants please feel encouraged to change the lcd.h to suit your needs.
